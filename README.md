## Usage

### Daily Calendar

Simply run:

```bash
orthofetch
```

It will display today's Orthodox calendar entry in a neat, aligned format with the Orthodox cross.

```bash
orthofetch --reading [NUM]
```

This will give you the full text of a specific reading for today. So if you see [1] John 3.15-18 for example you will get those verses to read.

### Bible Reading
```bash
orthofetch --bible
```

This will display all available Bible books organized by testament. 

**Updated Command Features:**
- **Multi-word book support**: `--bible "1 Kings" 3.1-5` works perfectly
- **Format flexibility**: Supports both dot (`3.1-5`) and colon (`3:1-5`) verse references
- **Complete reference options**: Single verse, verse ranges, full chapters
- **Deuterocanonical support**: `--bible "4 Maccabees"` and all deuterocanonical books
- **JSON-based structure**: Fast loading from JSON files instead of text files

```bash
orthofetch --bible [BOOK]
```

This will list all chapters in the specified book (e.g., `--bible John`).

```bash
orthofetch --bible [BOOK] [CHAPTER]
```

This will display the full chapter (e.g., `--bible John 3`).

```bash
orthofetch --bible [BOOK] [CHAPTER]:[VERSE]
```

This will display a specific verse (e.g., `--bible John 3:16`).

```bash
orthofetch --bible [BOOK] [CHAPTER]:[VERSE]-[VERSE]
```

This will display a range of verses (e.g., `--bible John 3:16-17`).

### Random Verses

```bash
orthofetch --random-verse
```

This will display a random verse from anywhere in the Bible.

```bash
orthofetch --random-verse [BOOK]
```

This will display a random verse from the specified book (e.g., `--random-verse Proverbs`).

### Display Options

```bash
orthofetch --no-color
```

This will take the color out of it making it plain text. This will also work with all other commands if you want to use it that way.
